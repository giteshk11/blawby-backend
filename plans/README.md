## üìä Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 days
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 days
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 days

**Total**: 10-14 days (2-3 weeks with buffer)

## üí° Key Principles

1. All amounts in **cents** (never floats)
2. Always verify **organization ownership**
3. Use Stripe **account context** on all calls
4. Implement proper **webhook verification**
5. Handle errors gracefully
6. Log all financial operations
7. Test thoroughly in test mode

---

## üîê Security Notes

- Never expose Stripe secret keys
- Always verify webhook signatures
- Never store card numbers

## ü§ù Working with Cursor

Each phase document is structured for easy AI-assisted implementation:

1. **Clear structure**: Database ‚Üí Repositories ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Routes
2. **SQL schemas**: Ready to convert to Drizzle migrations
3. **Logic steps**: Numbered, sequential implementation steps
4. **Code snippets**: Example implementations where needed
5. **Success criteria**: Clear checkboxes for completion

Simply open the phase document in Cursor and ask it to implement each section.

## ‚ùì Questions?

If you need clarification on any phase:
1. Review the specific phase document
2. Check the master plan for context
3. Refer to Stripe's documentation for API details
4. Use Stripe CLI to test webhooks locally

---

**Remember**: Complete Phase 1 first, then proceed sequentially. Each phase builds critical infrastructure for the next phase.
